\begin{abstract}

REcently proliferation of cheap 3-D sensors.
Lots of work on feature representations.
But no unified evaluation available.
We present an evaluation framework for point cloud-based recognition.
Flexible as to dataset and feature.
Modular design.
Provides several metrics.
Open source.
We hope that this becomes a standard evaluation for future featurizations for 3-D recognition tasks.

\section{ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION}
* describe the Proctor code

* synthetic approach, voting, kdTree stuff, PCL

\section{EVALUATION}

* provides the first results tables
* table per dataset
* features vs. metrics

* plots of the same data that's in the tables?

* confusion matrix figures

* table of timing results
